This project represents my capstone project for Fall 2022 at the Georgia Institute of Technology. All work here is for educational and research purposes, and it is not yet suited for production usage.

## Concept

After many years of design and gradual adoption, passwordless authentication is now being adopted by large companies such as Mirosoft, Apple, and Google. Passwordless authentication is designed to eliminate a large target for malicious users: passwords. 

As it is currently designed, passwordless authentication does not allow users to be able to share their accounts with others. I would like to introduce a novel concept of allowing users to securely share their accounts without risk of account takeover, and also allow IT auditing to identify which individual is accessing an account.
